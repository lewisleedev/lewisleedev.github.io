Ever since I started my very own, somewhat legit homelab, I tackled to take a shot at as many self-hosting options at hand. And it was successful; Nextcloud has been working without any hiccups with a couple of days of troubleshooting. Jellyfin, along with sonarr, radarr, and such, works like a charm.

But recently, I got more and more focused on degoogle and privacy. It's not that I wasn't aware of various privacy concerns. I'm pretty confident that I know enough privacy measures not to have any serious security risks. But I started to feel less comfortable having almost everything solely rely on Google's ecosystem. They work great. But I'm definitely not willing to store every valuable data I make on someone else's computer and more focused on decentralization at the moment.

It all started with [r/privacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy) I recently joined. When I saw the subreddit for the first time, I immediately realized that this is one of the deepest rabbit holes I'll be glad to hop into. From simple "use Firefox" to batshit paranoia, the only limit was how devoted am I to privacy. Here are several changes I've made(with no chronological order).

-   Ditched Gmail and moved to Protonmail. I subscribed to a yearly plan and am very happy with what they offer.
-   Self-hosted Bitwarden.
-   Ditched Microsoft Edge and moved to Firefox. Librewolf seemed much more promising but I figured hardening Firefox is enough.
-   Nextcloud photo backup. I'm planning to use Nextcloud exclusively if my homelab successfully holds up to more than a few months. Nextcloud offers so many functionalities that G-Suite offers and I've been very satisfied with it.
-   Duckduckgo. I already use DDG exclusively. Had no problem whatsoever, that is in the case of English. Korean search results are barely usable at best. Then again, I rarely search for anything in Korean. SearX seemed a little overwhelming for me.

Couple of things that I'm struggling with:

-   Using GNU/Linux. Unfortunately, I'm using Surface Laptop 4 and it turned out it's quite a hassle to use Linux on it(obviously). I also need some proprietary, mostly Korean software that has absolutely no Linux support.
-   NOT using Kakaotalk. A horrendous messaging app with a complete monopoly in South Korea made by the company Kakao, yet another big-tech-data-hogger. Virtually impossible not to use it.
-   Google Nest Hub. It's simply nonsense to talk about privacy and to put a 24/7 operating microphone in my room but it's just that good.

As much as I want to, I won't be getting rid of all the files on Google Drive, at least not for the time being. I don't think I'll ever ditch Google Play and only use F-droid. I'm already hearing things like "why are you being so paranoid" or "what kind of shady things do you do online?". If my goal is to be completely and perfectly anonymous online, that's simply impossible. But like any other things that I do, it's a real joy to dig down this deep, deep rabbit hole.
